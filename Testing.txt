RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Algorithm is an asymmetric or public-key cryptography algorithm which means it works on two different keys: Public Key and Private Key. The Public Key is used for encryption and is known to everyone, while the Private Key is used for decryption and must be kept secret by the receiver. RSA Algorithm is named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who published the algorithm in 1977.
