🔐 RSA File Encryption System

📜 Overview

The RSA File Encryption System is a secure way to encrypt and decrypt text files using the RSA algorithm. It ensures data protection by requiring a password for access and provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the content before storage. 
With this system, you can:
- Encrypt files to keep your data confidential.
- Decrypt files when you need to retrieve your original content.
- Protect file access with a password to prevent unauthorized use.
  
🛠️ Features

✔ Secure File Encryption – Encrypts every character using RSA for strong security.
✔ Decryption Support – Easily recover original content with the right decryption key.
✔ Password Protection – Restricts access to encryption and decryption operations.
✔ User-Friendly Interface – Simple menu-driven approach for seamless usage.
✔ No External Dependencies – Runs on standard C libraries.
