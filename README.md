#  RSA File Encryption System

##  Overview
The RSA File Encryption System is a secure way to encrypt and decrypt text files using the RSA algorithm. It ensures data protection by requiring a password for access and provides an additional layer of security by encrypting the content before storage. 
With this system, you can:
- Encrypt files to keep your data confidential.
- Decrypt files when you need to retrieve your original content.
- Protect file access with a password to prevent unauthorized use.

###  Features
- **Secure File Encryption** – Encrypts every character using RSA for strong security.
- **Decryption Support** – Easily recover original content with the right decryption key.
- **Password Protection** – Restricts access to encryption and decryption operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple menu-driven approach for seamless usage.
- **No External Dependencies** – Runs on standard C libraries.
